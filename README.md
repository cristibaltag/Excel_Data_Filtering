This is a project that I had to do for a client on Fiverr. He used a youtube scrapper to collect data from youtubers, I had to filter the data based on his requirements.

Their requirements were:
- Delete the entire rows based on a certain keyword found
- Delete the entire rows based on a column data ( I had a column with "Has a course link (Yes/No)
- Filtering by subscribers count ( 10.000 - 10k, 1.000.000 - 1M ) with the conversion done.
